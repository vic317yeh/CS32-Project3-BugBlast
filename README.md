CS32 project 3: BugBlast

The framework is provided by my professor. 
My job is to complete the Actor.h, Actor.cpp (contain all game objects' declarations and implementations), StudentWorld.h, and StudentWorld.cpp (contain implementations for the overall rules of the game) using the exisitng files.

Description: Bug Blast is a simplified version of the original Bomberman game created by Hudson Soft (based in Japan) 
in 1983. In Bug Blast, the player has to navigate through a series of mazes exterminating nasty bugs called Zumi using
bug spray. After exterminating all of the Zumi within a given maze, the player may head to the Exit square on that
level in order to advance to the next maze. The player wins by completing all of the mazes.
